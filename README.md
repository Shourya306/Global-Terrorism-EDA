# Abstract:

# Introduction:

Terrorism is the calculated use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby bring about a particular political objective. Terrorism has been practised by political organizations with both rightist and leftist objectives, by nationalistic and religious groups, by revolutionaries, and even by state institutions such as armies, intelligence services, and the police.

# Conclusion:

That is the end of my EDA project. I started the EDA with feature Selection, then dealt with null values, did some preliminary analysis using various plots, and also compared the terrorism of India with Iraq. From the EDA I have gained valuable insights into Terrorism. Some of the insights are as follows(for all the insights please check my notebook):

* Taliban is the most successful terrorist organisation.
* The most number of attacks took place in the year 2014.
* A large portion of terror attacks took place in Iraq.
